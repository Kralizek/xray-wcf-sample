# AWS X-Ray sample with WCF
This repository contains a multi-layer application that uses AWS X-Ray to trace the request flow across the different layers.
Specifically, this application uses WCF services that are able to relay the X-Ray trace context.

This sample will have pieces that are based on .NET Core and can be ran indifferently on Windows and Linux or Mac and pieces that can only be ran Windows because based on .NET Framework.
